## Context and Problem Statement

We want to encapsulate upstream responses (to an extent) so downstream clients are only shown what they need to see.

## Considered Options

* Filter `Link` field
* No other options were considered.

## Decision Outcome

Chosen option: "Filter `Link` field", because it is the only option considered.

### Consequences

* Good, because we can encapsulate Siebel functionality so downstream can focus more on data

* Negative consequences were not explored.
