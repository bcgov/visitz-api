## Context and Problem Statement

To improve general performance, we want to cache repetitive upstream requests that we expect will return the same value often.

## Decision Drivers

* Faster downstream response times
* Less burden on upstream during bursts of requests
* Cache life short enough to react to upstream changes but long enough to handle bursts

## Considered Options

* Cache repetitive responses with detailed keys
* No other options were considered.

## Decision Outcome

Chosen option: "Cache repetitive responses with detailed keys", because we satisfy most of the decision drivers.

### Consequences

* Good, because using detailed/complex cache keys gives us flexibility to keep caches localized (for better real-time object access across a system) or targeted reusability across different objects.

* Bad, because caching for any amount of time means we won't be able to react to upstream data changes in real-time.

    * We can use a short-lived cache time to mitigate this, but it will always affect requests in some form.
