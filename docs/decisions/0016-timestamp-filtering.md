## Context and Problem Statement

Using [available metadata](0007-row-metadata.md), we want a mechanism to filter downstream responses using a timestamp provided from downstream's original request.

## Decision Drivers

* Reducing downstream response payload size
* Ability to view *"recently updated"* information only

## Considered Options

* `After` timestamp
* No other options were considered.

## Decision Outcome

Chosen option: "`After` timestamp", because it satisfies decision drivers.

### Consequences

* Good, because downstream clients will have the option to reduce response payload sizes based on how recently they have used an endpoint previously.

* Bad, because this kind of filtering does not play nice with pagination and "implied" states based on visibility.

    * This can be worked aroundâ€”but does require extra work in every instance.

## More Information

Since we want information newer than the last time we use an endpoint, we chose the word "after" instead of "since" to more accurately describe its greater-than `>=` comparison to last-updated timestamp metadata.
